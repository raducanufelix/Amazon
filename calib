Calibration:

Try to be critical but fair, look at the facts. Candidates are expected to (and instructed to) use certain structure when answering LP questions, specifically they are using the STAR method, out of which for this review the most important are the Actions that the candidate took and the Results. When evaluating a candidate answer’s try to identify which portion of the answer matches each section of the STAR method.

When evaluating the Action portion of the STAR method consider the following:

Signs that we may be dealing with a limited answer:

The actions something that anyone would take in that situation
The candidate simply following their procedure.
The actions trivial or overly simplistic
It is not clear what the candidate’s actions even were.
The actions abstract or seem to come out of nowhere.
Signs of a good example:

The actions are bar-raising and seem justified and appropriate for the situation presented.
The candidate explains why they took those actions, and provides data to justify their decision.
The candidate mentions the actions that they themselves took and does not use “we” excessively.
When evaluating the Results portion of the STAR method, consider the following:

Signs that we may be dealing with a limited answer:

The results are missing.
The results are not detailed using any kind of data or numerical value.
The results are only trivially mentioned and are anecdotal.
Signs of a good example:

The results use data and metrics, reflecting what has changed after the actions were implemented
There is mention of a mechanism to ensure that this situation does not happen again
There is mention of lessons learned and additional follow-up actions
There is mention of follow-up discussions.
There is mention of any numerical data or quantifiable change or result.
